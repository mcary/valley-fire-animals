  <h1>About Valley Fire Lost & Found Animals</h1>
</div>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  This web site was created in response to the devastating Valley
  Fire, which started in Lake County, CA in 2015.  Its goal is to
  reunite owners and their pets or animals that were separated in
  the chaos of the rapidly spreading fire.

      I'm getting help from other Rails developers

      Rachel James) and more people spreading the word (Josh Simmons

      Aaron here, filling in for Marcel over the weekend.  There's been
      some confusion resulting from our new feature to mark animals and
      owners as reunited. I'm fixing false reports as quickly as I can.
      If you see an animal marked as reunited that's not, please let us
      know and I'll fix ASAP. In the meantime, I made a few changes to
      the process to hopefully reduce false reports.

      We've removed the incorrect "Reunited" designation from all the
      reports that were erroniously marked as such.  Sorry for the
      confusion.  We have three reports <em>confirmed</em> reunited
      and several more with confirmation pending.  With 93 reports,
      3578 users, it appears traffic to the site is starting to taper
      off.

      We've added a field just for Originating Location to help people
      search geographically.  We're hoping this helps people narrow
      down search results amid a sea of cats.  You can still use the
      "Words" search field to find locations mentioned in the summary
      or description.  We've only back-filled this field for some reports,
      so you may still need to check "none specified" as well for a while.

      Unclaimed animals will start to go up for adoption this week.
      Also, we've added export of search results to a spreadsheet to help

      at the bottom of the search page.
